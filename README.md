# What exactly is Syndicate?

A syndicated service is a research study that is conducted and funded by a market research firm.

It studies the various industrial trends for the user and provides the user one-click investment experience. Here you do not analyze the data; you don't have to get into how industry trends require no previous knowledge about the market. Syndicate is automating the process for more assured 
profit and lesser risk.

Regardless amount of time and knowledge you have about the current market.
Syndicate allows you to invest by providing the estimated risk and significant profit chances with just a few clicks.

# How we do it?

We stay updated with the market trends and progression in the industry and its tedious task.
Syndicate services use different techniques such as:
  - *Statistical tools* 
  - *Market Survey* 
  - *Historical Data*
  - *Financial Reports* 
  - *Trade Data*
Aiming to provide a holistic and meaningful view of the industry. 

# What does the process looks like?

This is how Syndicate is working in the backend. It refines the data for the last 60 days and then generalizing it into industrial information. It then calculates the moving average, then calculates the risks and returns, and predicts the trend for the next two days.

# what is the 10 and 13-day moving average. 

We found the moving average with respect to the advertising industry. The Red line shows the daily trends, but the blue line indicates the moving average on how the stock is behaving for the last 10 and 13 days. We take 10 and 13-day moving averages because, according to our research, the 10-day moving average must be greater than the 13-days moving average only then the trend is buying.

# Risk Vs. Return

The graph shows the various industries based on risk vs. returns.
Industries with the lowest risk and higher returns will be the best sector to invest in!
We have calculated the standard deviation from average returns.

For example, ophthalmic goods are the best industrial sector to invest in; it has the most negligible risk factor and the most returns.


# Future Scope for Syndicate

- Making the user experience for the customer very smooth and straightforward.
- Syndicate will provide the user with estimated growth output, analyze all the data study for the users, and provide a one-click investment experience.  
- Countries like India require many additional requirements for trading, like having a Demat account for every user.
- "Syndicate" tries to simplify this as it will work as a wallet system with the sole trading body being "Syndicate" itself.
